## Image Optimization

The images in this project are not optimized. For future work, it is recommended to:

1.  **Compress Images:** Use a tool like ImageOptim or TinyPNG to reduce the file size of all JPEG and PNG images.
2.  **Use WebP:** Convert images to the WebP format, which offers superior compression and quality compared to older formats.
3.  **Responsive Images:** Use the `<picture>` element or the `srcset` attribute to serve different image sizes for different screen resolutions.
4.  **Lazy Loading:** Ensure that all images are lazy-loaded to improve initial page load time.
